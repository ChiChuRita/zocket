**Zocket** is a type-safe WebSocket library that provides end-to-end type safety between client and server, inspired by tRPC. Build real-time applications with confidence using TypeScript and your favorite schema validation library (Zod, Valibot, or any Standard Schema compatible library).

## Key Features

- **End-to-end Type Safety**: Full TypeScript inference from server to client. Change your server code, and your client code updates automatically.
- **Schema Validation**: Works with Zod, Valibot, and any Standard Schema compatible library to validate inputs and outputs.
- **Real-time Rooms**: Built-in support for WebSocket rooms/channels for targeted broadcasting (e.g., chat rooms, notifications).
- **Middleware Support**: Composable middleware for authentication, logging, error handling, and context injection.
- **Runtime Agnostic**: Server is adapter-based (Bun adapter included today) and the client works anywhere with `WebSocket`.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Use with any framework (Next.js, Nuxt, React, Vue) or vanilla JS/TS.

## Why Zocket?

Building real-time applications often involves manually syncing types between the backend and frontend. If you change a message structure on the server, you have to remember to update the client code.

**Zocket solves this by inferring types directly from your server router.**

### vs. Socket.io
Socket.io is great but lacks built-in end-to-end type safety. You often have to maintain shared interface definitions manually. Zocket gives you the same real-time capabilities (rooms, broadcasting) but with the developer experience of tRPC.

### vs. tRPC
tRPC is amazing for request/response (HTTP/RPC) flows. Zocket brings that same DX to **WebSockets** and **Event-driven** architectures, where the server can push data to the client at any time, not just in response to a request.
