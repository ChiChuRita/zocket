When you construct a message, you must specify who receives it.

### Broadcast
Sends the message to **all** connected clients.

```typescript
send.chat.message({ ... }).broadcast();
```

### Direct Message
Sends the message to specific client IDs.

```typescript
send.chat.message({ ... }).to([targetClientId]);
```

### Rooms
Sends the message to all clients in a specific room.

```typescript
send.chat.message({ ... }).toRoom(["room-123"]);
```

`toRoom(...)` and `broadcast()` use the adapter’s pub/sub when available (Bun supports this). If your adapter doesn’t support publishing, Zocket falls back to less efficient strategies or logs a warning (depending on the target method).
