## Subscriptions (Listening)

Use the `.on` property to listen for events from the server.

```typescript
const unsubscribe = client.on.system.notification((data) => {
  // 'data' is inferred from your server router
  toast(data.message);
});

// Later, to stop listening:
unsubscribe();
```

## RPC (Request / Response)

You can call server procedures and await a response.

```typescript
try {
  const user = await client.users.get({ id: "123" });
  console.log("User found:", user.name);
} catch (err) {
  // 'err' will catch any errors thrown by the server handler
  console.error("User not found or server error");
}
```

## Fire-and-Forget

If your server handler doesn't return anything (or returns `void`), the promise resolves as soon as the message is sent.

```typescript
// This sends the message and resolves immediately
await client.analytics.track({ event: "click" });
```
