For the best developer experience, always export your router type from the server and import it (as a type) in the client.

```typescript
// server.ts
export type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;

// client.ts
import type { AppRouter } from "./server";
// Use generic
const client = createZocketClient<AppRouter>(...);
```

This ensures that `client` has all the methods and types inferred from your server code. You **do not** need to import the runtime router code in the client, keeping your bundle size small.
