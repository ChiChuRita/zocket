While Zocket provides a high-performance, type-safe foundation for WebSocket applications, it is currently in early development. This document tracks known limitations and areas where the developer experience can be improved.

## 1. Resilience & Connection Management

The client implementation is currently "manual" and requires developers to handle connection stability themselves.

- **No Auto-Reconnection**: The client does not automatically attempt to reconnect when a connection is dropped. Developers must manually listen to `onClose` events and call `reconnect()`.
- **Missing Backoff Strategies**: There is no built-in logic for exponential backoff or jitter, which can lead to "thundering herd" issues when a server restarts.
- **No Heartbeats/Ping-Pong**: There is no explicit mechanism to detect "zombie" connections where the socket appears open but is non-functional.

## 2. React State Management

The provided React hooks are basic and lack features found in modern data-fetching libraries.

- **No Caching/Deduplication**: Multiple components calling the same procedure will result in multiple network requests.
- **No Window Focus Refetching**: The library doesn't automatically sync state when the window regains focus.
- **No Optimistic Updates**: There is no built-in pattern for updating the local UI before a server response is received.

## 3. Configuration & Timeouts

- **Hardcoded RPC Timeouts**: The RPC mechanism uses a fixed 10-second timeout that cannot currently be configured per-call or globally.
- **Inflexible Headers**: While URL query parameters are used for authentication (due to browser limits), there is no support for "initial message" authentication patterns.

## 4. Scalability (Multi-Node)

- **Single-Node Pub/Sub**: The room broadcasting system relies on native adapter methods (like `Bun.publish`), which are scoped to a single server instance.
- **No Distributed Pub/Sub**: There is currently no official adapter for Redis, NATS, or other message brokers to handle broadcasting across multiple server instances.

## 5. Testing & Mocking

- **Network Dependency**: Testing routers requires spinning up a full WebSocket server.
- **Missing Mock Utilities**: There are no utilities (like a `createCaller` for testing) to invoke server procedures directly in unit tests without network overhead.

## Roadmap & Planned Improvements

The following items are already on our immediate roadmap and will address many of the points above:
- **Adapters for Node.js and Deno**
- **Binary Serialization Support** (e.g., MessagePack)
- **Typed Errors** and improved error handling
- **Automatic Reconnection** logic in the client
- **Middleware improvements** for better context management
