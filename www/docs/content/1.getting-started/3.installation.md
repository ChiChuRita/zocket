# Installation

Zocket is available as multiple packages depending on your needs:

- `@zocket/core` - Core library (server + client)
- `@zocket/react` - React hooks integration

## Prerequisites

- **TypeScript**: 5.0 or higher
- **Runtime**: Bun (recommended) or Node.js
- **Validator**: Zod or Valibot (your choice)

## Install Core Package

::code-group

```bash [bun]
bun add @zocket/core zod
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @zocket/core zod
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @zocket/core zod
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @zocket/core zod
```

::

### Using Valibot Instead

If you prefer Valibot over Zod:

::code-group

```bash [bun]
bun add @zocket/core valibot
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @zocket/core valibot
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @zocket/core valibot
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @zocket/core valibot
```

::

## Install React Package (Optional)

If you're building a React application:

::code-group

```bash [bun]
bun add @zocket/react
```

```bash [npm]
npm install @zocket/react
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @zocket/react
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @zocket/react
```

::

The React package has peer dependencies on `react` (18+) and `@zocket/core`.

## TypeScript Configuration

Ensure your `tsconfig.json` has these settings:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "moduleResolution": "bundler", // or "node16"
    "target": "ES2020",
    "lib": ["ES2020"]
  }
}
```

The `strict` mode is highly recommended to get the full benefits of Zocket's type safety.

## Project Structure

Here's a recommended project structure for a Zocket application:

```
my-app/
├── server/
│   ├── index.ts          # Server entry point
│   ├── router.ts         # Router definitions
│   └── handlers.ts       # Message handlers
├── shared/
│   └── types.ts          # Shared types (router export)
└── client/
    ├── index.ts          # Client entry point
    └── client.ts         # Client setup
```

For monorepos or full-stack applications, you might use:

```
my-app/
├── apps/
│   ├── server/
│   │   └── src/
│   │       ├── index.ts
│   │       └── router.ts
│   └── web/
│       └── src/
│           ├── App.tsx
│           └── client.ts
└── packages/
    └── shared/
        └── types.ts      # Shared router types
```

## Verify Installation

Create a test file to verify everything is working:

```typescript
// test.ts
import { zocket } from "@zocket/core";
import { z } from "zod";

const zo = zocket.create({
  headers: z.object({}),
});

console.log("Zocket installed successfully!");
```

Run it:

::code-group

```bash [bun]
bun test.ts
```

```bash [tsx (Node)]
npx tsx test.ts
```

```bash [ts-node (Node)]
npx ts-node test.ts
```

::

You should see "Zocket installed successfully!" printed to the console.

## Runtime-Specific Notes

### Bun (Recommended)

Zocket has first-class support for Bun with the `createBunServer` function:

```typescript
import { createBunServer } from "@zocket/core";

const handlers = createBunServer(appRouter, zo);

Bun.serve({
  fetch: handlers.fetch,
  websocket: handlers.websocket,
  port: 3000,
});
```

### Node.js

For Node.js, you'll need to use an adapter. A generic adapter is provided:

```typescript
import { createServer } from "@zocket/core";
import { nodeAdapter } from "@zocket/core/adapters/node"; // Coming soon

const server = createServer(appRouter, zo, nodeAdapter);
```

Note: Node.js adapter is in development. For now, Bun is recommended.

## Client-Side Notes

### Browser

Zocket works in all modern browsers that support WebSocket:

```typescript
import { createZocketClient } from "@zocket/core";

const client = createZocketClient("ws://localhost:3000");
```

### React Native

For React Native, ensure you have a WebSocket polyfill:

```bash
npm install react-native-websocket
```

Then use Zocket normally.

### Next.js

Zocket works with Next.js for both client and server components. Use dynamic imports for client-side code:

```typescript
// app/components/Chat.tsx
"use client";

import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
import { createZocketClient } from "@zocket/core";

const Chat = () => {
  const client = createZocketClient("ws://localhost:3000");
  // ...
};

export default Chat;
```
